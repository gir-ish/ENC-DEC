to introduce randomness i have decided to do the following operation let see first we will take a random number from 4-9 but not 5 and store it as the first index at our encrypted code then we will apply the following to our text
After the whole txt file is encrypted lets see we have a number who on encypted gives a code 4571245712 so to introduce randomness first we will look at the random number which we genrated earlier lets take an example where we took random number 7 so from now we will add number 1 to 7 in loop to all the indexes of our encrypted code like 1+4,2+5,3+7 in case if the sum is a two digit number we will do modulus 10 on it and apply it to all the bits of the encrypted code remember to store the random number generted at start so it will help in decryption process do you understand it if yes tell me the summary and if you have any question you can ask me
