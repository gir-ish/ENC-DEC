We are using system process that runs the gunicorn to run the flask app. System process is located at
/etc/systemd/system/flask_app.service

Whenever you make changes to the flask_app.py file you must restart the service to take the affect.
sudo systemctl restart flask_app

check status
sudo systemctl status flask_app

We are then using ngnix as proxy.
sudo systemctl restart nginx
